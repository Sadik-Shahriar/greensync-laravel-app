          question: "How do I start earning eco-points with GreenSync?",
          answer: "Simply sign up for a GreenSync account, locate a smart bin on your campus, and scan the QR code with your smartphone. After properly disposing your waste, you'll automatically earn eco-points based on the type and amount of waste disposed."
        },
        {
          question: "What types of waste can I dispose of in GreenSync bins?",
          answer: "GreenSync smart bins accept various waste types including plastic bottles, paper, cardboard, organic waste, and metal cans. Each bin is clearly labeled with accepted materials, and our sensors verify proper sorting."
        },
        {
          question: "Is GreenSync free to use?",
          answer: "Yes! GreenSync is completely free for students, faculty, and staff at participating institutions. Your institution covers the costs as part of their sustainability initiative."

      questions: [
        {
          question: "How are eco-points calculated?",
          answer: "Eco-points are awarded based on the type of waste, proper sorting accuracy, and disposal frequency. Plastic bottles earn 5 points, paper items earn 3 points, organic waste earns 4 points, and metal cans earn 6 points. Bonus points are given for consistent daily usage."
        },
        {
          question: "What rewards can I redeem with my eco-points?",
          answer: "You can redeem eco-points for digital badges, campus store discounts, dining hall credits, priority parking passes, and exclusive sustainability merchandise. Special rewards include Eco-Steward Certificates and recognition ceremonies."
        },
        {
          question: "Do my eco-points expire?",
          answer: "No, your eco-points never expire! However, leaderboard rankings are calculated monthly, and some limited-time rewards may have expiration dates."

          answer: "The Eco-Steward Certification is a prestigious recognition awarded to users who reach 1,000 eco-points and demonstrate consistent sustainable behavior. It includes a downloadable certificate, special badge, and exclusive access to sustainability leadership programs."
        },
        {
          question: "How long does it take to earn the certification?",
          answer: "The time varies based on your disposal frequency and accuracy. Active users typically earn certification within 2-3 months of regular participation. The certification recognizes both quantity and quality of sustainable actions."

    {
      category: "Waste Verification",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "How does GreenSync verify proper waste disposal?",
          answer: "Our smart bins use advanced sensors and AI-powered image recognition to verify waste type and proper sorting. The system provides instant feedback and only awards points for correctly disposed items."
        },
        {
          question: "What happens if I dispose waste incorrectly?",
          answer: "If waste is disposed incorrectly, the system will provide educational feedback but won't award points. Repeated incorrect disposal may trigger additional educational resources to help improve sorting accuracy."
